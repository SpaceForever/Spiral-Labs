# SuperMemo

Program for massive, fun learning and acquisition of [[knowledge]] using [[Incremental Reading]], created by [[Woz]]

Alternative: [[Increment]]



See [[Spreading SuperMemo]] for details on how we intend to spread SuperMemo and love of learning across the world.

## Things to consider
### Formulation
- making clozes out of concepts, not words
- 

## Priority Protection
The lower your priority protection, the more golden nuggets (if you have highly applicable knowledge). 
- perhaps become more picky with imports, and more trigger happy with done!
