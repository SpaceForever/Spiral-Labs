# Ergodocity

tradeoff between short-term performance and long-term risk

i read it from luca book
good book

core example: imagine you are skiier and 10 races
10% chance break knees 10% chance to win
no one would take those odds because very good chance youd never play again!
terrible!

but in day to day life people make that mistake over and over
