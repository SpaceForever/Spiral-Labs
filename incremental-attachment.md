# Incremental Attachment

Don't take everyone's opinion equally seriusly until you get to know them and if their opinion is worth taking seriously.

Those closer to you, who've earned your seriorsity through their sanity and sensibleness, take the most seriously.

“We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”

despite appearing to love ourselves more than other people and take ourselves more seriously, we value their opinino more. Why is that? Why isn't incremental attatchment the default?
