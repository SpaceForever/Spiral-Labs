## Improving Meetings

How to have useful meetings?

### Techniques
1. Every 10 minutes, write down what has been accomplished. 
    - timers and deadlines force [[priority-protection-in-real-life]]
    - does this impact flow?
2. After the meeting, write down what things could've been said in an email
    - ensures meetings are retaining value
