# Priority Protection in Real Life

Raj: nice let me know how it goes. I’m thinking I want to have less friends. Too much threads. My real life prioritiy protection is terrible.

 

I’m thinking model of: real life priority protection, is interesting and worth pursuing. My target priority protection for everything is 40%, want to ignore stuff below that. And in a year when I’m even coole ri think it’ll be 10% because I’ll have at least 5x the opportunities or the higher ones will be that much cooler
