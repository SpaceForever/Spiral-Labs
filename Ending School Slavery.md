# Ending School Slavery

Notes from sock: don't worry about growing and growing and growing. If you have stuf fhta't slready great, go for it. You could go on indefinately with adding things, but don't do that. The scope should be small, and reavaluate from there. 

Lunis: look at it from a EA lense. 'Tractability' 'Neglectedness' issues
could be easy to find weak leverage points. try find points of high leverage points. 

Be careful of it being a bottomless well of effort. make sure the stuff you're doing is high effort. What's your precise angle?

space: perhaps look at things that already have support

## Next Steps
### Space
1. (Space) Learn what kind of material actually goes viral among teenagers
	1. Ask friends
### Raj
1. (Raj) buy [[EndSchoolSlavery.com]]
   1. Redirect to smg for now is fine

## Goal
- Actually *actually* change it.


Every child has choice adnd chooses what they do
- Kids are safe , looked after

- Freedom from authority control

- freedom from ignorance of options (mental blocks)
	- understand the actual value in thall thoptions (eg. homeschooling isn't waste of time)

Focus on mental blocks!

Spreading rationality...
