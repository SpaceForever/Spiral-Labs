# Do The Real Thing

The reason why doing nothing is better than doing a fake version of the thing is because it MEETS THE SAME DESIRES so stops you from seeking out the best version of the thing WITHOUT FULLY QUENCHING the desire!!

Hammertime calls this 'experiential pica'. 

Doing nothing. What does that look like?
