# Wiki

## Solved: Foam!

## Always Sharing
- Ask on Foam
- Wait for Raj's answer

- Try out other random extensions?
- Ask in uofb?
- Auto Commit (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zeitnergmbh.auto-git)

## Problems
- Incremental Writing
  - Write a proposal
    - [[Priorities]]
    - Intervals
    - 

- Private vs Public

## 






I reccomend using Obsidian Publish as something that is quick and effective. Can ralley obsidian to push collaboration to the top of their priority list. Until then we can screenshare on one person doing it, which can be me. 


- Obsidian publish
- mediawiki
- supermemo.wiki


woz talks about wikis here in email between us:

I think wikis are the answer to all collective brainwork. e-mail is more like signaling: reminder, creative burst, link, etc. if it does not get hammered into a wiki, it is just chat [btw: this line is important, and shows how your e-mail, signals an important problem that, in the future, should be somewhere included in the semantic net of a wiki]

# Importance
- Publishing
- ease of adding ideas
- ease of intervalling
- obsidian-level backlinking

Supermemo.guru - knowledge is assumed because everything is interlinked

[[obsidian + google docs]]
 

If you just set your alarm earlier, it'll still be a perpetual state of unhappiness, 1-2 h delay overlap. It'd still be terrible. 

If i doxxed myself on gingerjumble it'd be cooler
