# Formula for Self Improvement

You need to align your body and then your mind to be on your side and working for you without pain or force.

## Body Alignment

1. Excercise
    - Start small
      - start just walking up and down your road
    - do it *every day* for habit formation
    - do it from the moment you get up as a reliable trigger
    - prioritise it over EVERYTHING examples
    - Running is simple, running is fun. Walk, then run.
