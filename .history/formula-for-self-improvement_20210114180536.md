# Formula for Self Improvement

You need to align your body and then your mind to be on your side and working for you without pain or force.

You are a [[Genius]] when you excercise everyday, work everyday, set large goals and enjoy your work and have internal peace.

## Body Alignment

      - start just walking up and down your road
    - do it *every day* for habit formation
    - do it from the moment you get up as a reliable trigger
    - prioritise it over EVERYTHING examples
    - Running is simple, running is fun. Walk, then run.

2. Sleep
   - determine an activity you'll do before bed that's sleep inducing
   - Set a total block on your computer past that time  
     - focusme
     - google shutdown
