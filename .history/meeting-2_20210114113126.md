Hi Space 

Effective altruism can include thinking about how we might improve ourselves, not just our donations and career impact. Sometimes that means accepting some of the emotional challenges of altruism as well as trying to achieve personal goals.

Given that it's a new year and a good time to reflect, here are a few resources to help organise your thoughts: 

* Clearer Thinking's Lifetime Aspirations (helping you create a road map for achieving your most important goals)
* Alex Vermeer's 8,760 Hours (how to get the most out of next year and reviewing last year)
* 80,000 Hours Annual Career Review , they also have an update to their career planning guide 
* If you want to have a chat about careers, donations, volunteering or goals for the year, you can sign up here
