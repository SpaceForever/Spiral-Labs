# Formula for Self Improvement

You need to align your body and then your mind to be on your side and working for you without pain or force.

You are a [[Genius]] when you excercise everyday, work everyday, set large goals and enjoy your work and have internal peace.

## Level 1: Body Alignment

1. Excercise
    - Start small
      - start just walking up and down your road
    - do it *every day* for habit formation
    - do it from the moment you get up as a reliable trigger
    - prioritise it over EVERYTHING examples
    - Running is simple, running is fun. Walk, then run.

2. Sleep
   - determine an activity you'll do before bed that's sleep inducing
   - Set a total block on your computer / phone past that time. AIM LOW (eg. 3am) 
     - focusme
     - windows task scheduler
   - Tell your friends to pester you if you stay up too late
    - Only take caffeine first thing apon waking
   - Limit use of alarm clock

## Level 2: Maintaining Your Sanity (Addiction & Scope & Friendship)

3. Freeing from Addictions
    - Delete accounts from obvious offenders and remove from phone
    - tell friends to message you elsewhere. If they refuse, accept it and move anyway.
    - Embrace silence
      - slowly shift from media which takes up all your senses while eating (TV) to media that uses less (like podcasts). Then shift towards silence during meals. do this INCREMENTAlLy. Meals are vital thinking time.
      - If you haven't broken the sanctity of the bathroom as tech-free zone, DON'T! EVER! Phase away from using your phone as you sit on the toilet and having sound on as you shower. Reclaim the thinking time.
    - Eliminate Bad Addictions
      - A good heuretic for the quality of an addiction: if you doubled the amount of time spent on it, would you be happy? And, are you happy after finishing it? Learning and excercise pass both these tests.
