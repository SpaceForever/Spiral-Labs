# Self Coercion

Many people don't realize but is really bad and if need to use (e.g. on sleep) likely something else is going wrong

You need to work on [[internal alignment]] so that things like these can come naturally.

as [[Mark Manson]] says every battle across humanity is between System 1 and System 2 and when you get them aligned you are strong.

> Similarly, it's the options you can't weigh that really cost you.People often seem to use the word "should" to assign a value of "negative infinity" to all alternative actions They should do X, so if they don't do X, they're bad, end of story. Some people have trouble unpacking a should for the same reason they have trouble staring at a failure: they have a mental geas against seriously considering alternatives, against weighing them on the scales. One common symptom of this behavior is a tendency to do a fake unpacking of the should, e.g. by translating "I should finish this paper" to "I need to finish this paper": notice how this trades one negative-infinity analysis for another, without ever reconnecting the task to the goal or acknowledging the alternatives.

When you [[Cash out your shoulds]] it should lead to a reduction in coercion necessary. When you remember what's actually at stake, you don't need to push yourself.

[[Problem Mapping]] should also help lead to reduce force necessary.



And remmeber, [[negative emotions aren't useful]]. Thus don't self-coerce.
