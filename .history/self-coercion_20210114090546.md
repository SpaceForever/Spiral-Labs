# Self Coercion

Many people don't realize but is really bad and if need to use (e.g. on sleep) likely something else is going wrong

You need to work on [[internal alignment]] so that things like these can come naturally.

as [[Mark Manson]] says every battle across humanity is between System 1 and System 2 and when you get them aligned you are strong.

When you [[Cash out your shoulds]] it should lead to a reduction in coercion necessary. When you remember what's actually at stake, you don't need to push yourself.

[[Problem Mapping]] should also help lead to reduce force necessary

And remmeber, [[negative emotions aren't useful]]. Thus don't self-coerce.
