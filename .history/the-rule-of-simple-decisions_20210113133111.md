# The Rule of Simple Decisions

Never make 100 decisions when 1 will suffice.

Don't overcomplicate your life.

This might seem trite but pragmatically it works. If you try to [[persuade]] someone of something by making the right choice at each node, it'll be too much cognitive effort to micromanage. Having values (or [[principles]] as Ray Dalio puts it) is a good way to manage this.

This is directly tied in to decision fatigue. Steve Jobs, a known [[Genius]], applied this by wearing the same clothes everyday. Why make 365 individual decisions each year about what to wear?

## Applications

Having a daily [[Plan]] is a way to remove thousands of decisions about what to do each second of the day.

### Routes
Having a walking routine or running routine is a good way to not waste mental energy deciding which way to go.

### Phone Calls
Schedule reccurring meeting times with your friends
