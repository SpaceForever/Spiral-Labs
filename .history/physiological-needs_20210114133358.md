# Physiological Needs

The more important one over [[physiological-needs]] and [[psychological-needs]].

Your body is not negotiable, if it feels terrible and needs to move it needs to move.
Treat it well and you'll propser. See [[Woz]] and [[Naval Ravikant]] for examples of people who appear exceedingly happy and have prioritised health.

## Excercise
Keep it simple. Just run. Start small with walks then build up.

## Nutrition
Slowly phase out sugar.
