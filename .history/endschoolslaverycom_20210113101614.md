   1. Outside the labratory, eliezer yudkowsky. if you see the value of freedom for you, then it should apply to kids too. If not, it's like washing your hands when you're a chef, but not doing it at home. If you don't follow the rules everywhere, if you don't take your professed values seriously, then you don't really understand why those values are good.
