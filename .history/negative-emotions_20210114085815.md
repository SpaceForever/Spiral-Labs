# Negative Emotions Aren't Useful

> Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. It’s not like your unhappiness makes them better off somehow. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. Keeping death on the forefront and not denying it is very important.

unhappiness serves absolutely no one. Unless it's in terms of signalling that you need help, and you're unable to fix it yourself. 

It doesn't help your problem solving ability (because it limits creativity), it barely makes you happier, and spreads unhappiness in the universe

being unhappy for the purpose of others isn't helpful either, if they'rr far away. It gives you warm fuzzies but if you actually care and want to help happy-up and do some actually effective altruism.
