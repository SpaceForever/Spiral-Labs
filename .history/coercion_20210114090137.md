# Coercion

When you are being given artifical incentives to doing things you wouldn't have wanted to do otherwise.

Eg. being given the incentive to avoid prison is a form of coercion in getting parents to force their children to attend [[schooling]]

Coercion is generally an enemy to true [[freedom]]

[[self coercion]]



## Is being resistant to coercion a weakness?
The sleep of [[Jame]] and [[Timepoof]] both seem to be poor due to unwilligness to use focusme due to resistance to coercion.

Does [[Woz]] manage without coercion?
