# Capture Concepts Not Words
[[Formulation]], [[Supermemo]]

what's the concept here, how does it connect to things.

If i can connect it to other things, it's gonna be usfeul. If not, read more.



how is this applicable?
- tie the situation to the response.
- tie the entire network to eachother. because it's coherent, it'll come to you anwyay. When they're already connected it'll happen by itselt. 

Could to a combination of the two, doesn't hurt.

should you make cards of 'how are x & y connected?' 
Naess / strat have info on this.

can make cards 40/50% better.

If you can link it to something else, you understand it. When you look for connections, you're actually learning it.
