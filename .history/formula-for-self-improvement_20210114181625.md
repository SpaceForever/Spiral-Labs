      - start just walking up and down your road
    - do it *every day* for habit formation
    - do it from the moment you get up as a reliable trigger
    - prioritise it over EVERYTHING examples
    - Running is simple, running is fun. Walk, then run.

2. Sleep
   - determine an activity you'll do before bed that's sleep inducing
   - Set a total block on your computer / phone past that time. AIM LOW (eg. 3am) 
     - focusme
     - windows task scheduler
   - Tell your friends to pester you if you stay up too late
    - Only take caffeine first thing apon waking
   - Limit use of alarm clock

Do these well and your body should be on your side.
