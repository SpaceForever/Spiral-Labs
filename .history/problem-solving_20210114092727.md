# Problem Solving

Cornerstone of [[Intelligence]]



## Techniques
- [[Inversion]]
  
From Principles:
The five steps are

Set clear goals 
Identify the problems that stand in your way 
Diagnose root causes to those problems 
Design plans to get around those problems 
Execute and push through to results
The steps loop because once you get the results you want, you’ll naturally set your sights on the next goal. A key point about the 5-Step Process is that the steps must be done one at a time. For example,when you set goals, just set goals. Don’t think about how you will achieve them or what you’ll do if something goes wrong.
