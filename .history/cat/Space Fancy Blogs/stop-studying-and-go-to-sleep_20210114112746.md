# Stop studying and go to sleep

At each line split, I give you permission to go to sleep and come back to this tomorrow.

> - You've made a mistake. Write down what went wrong and never make the same mistake again, then stop punishing yourself.
> - Your health is all that you have.
> - If you disrespect your sleep now, you will disrespect your sleep always.
> - If you do great on this test and it really was too much to study, you set the precedent to the teacher that it's okay to set this much.
> - Stop studying and go to sleep.

You've fucked up. You have the Big Test tomorrow and you're studying feverently into the ungodly hours, trying to cram as much info into your head as you can. The Panic Monster has fully and truly danwed apon your brain. 

You may be watching motivation videos every once in a while. 

Every couple minutes you fight off the urge to collapse into the unconscious your brain so desperately wants to retreat to, armed against the tug of sleep by the shame you know you'll feel if you stop studying now.

Well I have an unorthodox bit of advice. I hereby give you permission to:

**Stop studying and go to sleep**.

You've *made* your mistake. You didn't start studying soon enough. Good. Fine. Write down what you've done wrong, write it down in a way you'll *know you'll come back to so you don't make the same mistake again*, and then never make the same mistake again. Write down exactly what algorithm in your decision making process led to your failure, and go into your code, fix that bug, and then go to sleep.

You've *made* your mistake, and you've already paid for it by how late it's gotten now, while you're still trying to desperately cram junk into your brain. Suffer no more. You know what you did wrong, you know how you're going to make it never happen again — **go to sleep**. 

You're only as good at anything as your body lets you be - if you treat your body crappily it'll return the favour with decreased energy and generally feelings of anguish and angst you can't quite point to the source of until you remember 'oh yeah, I stayed up till three last night for this'.

If you want to perform well on a test, fucking up your sleep is probably the best thing you can do to sabotage that. I sure as hell know that my number one bottle neck to clear thinking is my sleep.

**So stop studying and go to sleep.**

Keep in mind that your life is never going to change that much, because you take your brain with you wherever you go, into whichever mystical tomorrows you take your brain to, expecting it to change. If you want your brain some day to be the kind that isn't stressed and is healthy, you have to change the one your carrying now — tomorrow doesn't exist. [Tomorrows are just todays](https://gingerjumble.wordpress.com/2021/01/04/tomorrows-are-just-todays/).

If you disrespect your sleep now for what's considered "important" (keeping in mind your sleep is the very *cornerstone* for your health, your [intellegence](https://hackernoon.com/biohack-your-intelligence-now-or-become-obsolete-97cdd15e395f), and your wellbeing - you're *wellbeing*, the very thing I desperately hope you're [fighting for](http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/)) you'll *always* disrespect your sleep for what's considered important. Break the chain now. Prioritize your health and wellbeing, it's all that you are.

The less you sleep, the shorter your life.

If you don't sleep, you die. Seriously. 

Disrespecting your sleep is prolonged suicide.

**Stop studying and go to sleep.**

— 

Perhaps when you were cashing out what you should've changed about your behaviour, you actually didn't find anything. Now that's probably wrong, since you almost definately could've done something beter, but if all your classmates are also staying up till whatever ungodly hour you're reading this at, there's a good chance your teacher is the one who messed up and set you way more to study than is feasible.

If you keep studying now, and especially if you end up doing good on this test tomorrow, you send one clear message to your teacher:

'It's okay to set this amount of homework. Midnight to 3am is totally fine when considering how much time we have for how much homework you're setting. We value our health little and your class more, to the extent that we are willing to kill ourselves over a prolonged period of time for it.' 

Which is dishonest. 

As is transparent by even just this example, lying is the royal road to all chaos, the most self-inflicted of humanities suffering. 

Don't contribute.

**Stop studying and go to sleep.**

— 

The education system is an abhorrent waste of time, emotion, and energy for *everyone* involved. It's torture, and it's the worst type of torture because it convinces you that you chose it, and that it's good for you.

You never wanted this and you know it.

The universe didn't exist for billions of years, the earth jump through millions of hurdles to be sustainable, humanity didn't fight wars and evolve for millenia, so that other humans could tell you what to put into your brain.

You never wanted this and you know it. The system propagates on delusion and compliance.

Stop giving every part of yourself to a destiny you didn't choose.

End school slavery.

Stop studying and go to sleep.

  - School is TORTURE. The worse kind because it tells you you want it. You never wanted it and you know it. Stop giving every part of you to a destiny you didn't choose. make a small contribution to Ending School Slavery and **stop studying and go to sleep**.
