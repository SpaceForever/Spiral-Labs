# Stop studying and go to sleep

At each line split, I give you permission to go to sleep and come back to this tomorrow.

You've fucked up. You have the Big Test tomorrow and you're studying feverently into the ungodly hours, trying to cram as much info into your head as you can. The Panic Monster has fully and truly danwed apon your brain. 

You may be watching motivation videos every once in a while. 

Every couple minutes you fight off the urge to collapse into the unconscious your brain so desperately wants to retreat to, armed against the tug of sleep by the shame you know you'll feel if you stop studying now.

Well I have an unorthodox bit of advice. I hereby give you permission to:

**Stop studying and go to sleep**.

You've *made* your mistake. You didn't start studying soon enough. Good. Fine. Write down what you've done wrong, write it down in a way you'll *know you'll come back to so you don't make the same mistake again*, and then never make the same mistake again. Write down exactly what algorithm in your decision making process led to your failure, and go into your code, fix that bug, and then go to sleep.

You've *made* your mistake, and you've already paid for it by how late it's gotten now, while you're still trying to desperately cram junk into your brain. Suffer no more. You know what you did wrong, you know how you're going to make it never happen again — **go to sleep**. 

You're only as good at anything as your body lets you be - if you treat your body shittily it'll return the favour with decreased energy and generally feelings of anguish and angst you can't quite point to the source of until you remember 'oh yeah, I stayed up till three last night for this'.

If you want to perform well on a test, fucking up your sleep is probably the best thing you can do to sabotage that. I sure as hell know that my number one bottle neck to clear thinking is my sleep.

- replacing guilt style 

- your life will never be different
  - if you disrespect your sleep for what's considered "important" now you'll keep doing so forever. break the chain now.
- This is veyr much school's fault
  - mention this not to disrepect stoic responsibility but to kindle fire to end school's cruel slavery.

- schools put no upper limit
  - by *killing yourself* to get good grades you raise the bar for the other students, telling the school that yes, this is something students will in general do, and that past midnight is completely viable time to factor in when setting homework.
  - School is TORTURE. The worse kind because it tells you you want it. You never wanted it and you know it. Stop giving every part of you to a destiny you didn't choose. make a small contribution to Ending School Slavery and **stop studying and go to sleep**.
