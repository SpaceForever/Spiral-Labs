# Planning Fallacy

A very important [[Cognitive Bias]] that is rather easy to fix.

Planning fallacy states that human beings are terrible at planning

Outside view and general overcorrection can be used to correct for planning fallacy

inside view vs outside view

inside view: predict based on what has happened to you
outside view: predict based on similar classes


Emotional planning fallacy: very often we construct overly pessimistic representations of reality based on inferred evidence.
This can trigger negative emotions like anxiety or stress. Every time it happens it feels like this is really bad and serious but on average they really aren't.
To fix this, application of outside view helps. E.g. when I feel stress because someone said something not nice to me, I could think about past situations and how I reacted and see if the reaction I used was actually helpful. If it wasn't, I now have evidence that that approach doesn't make sense and it is easier to leave delusion
