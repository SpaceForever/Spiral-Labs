# Idea Generation

for it you must:
[[Take Ideas Seriously]] and view thinking as a [[non-problem]]
you must love thinking and then it'll just be easy and natural and they'll come to you
most people don't take ideas seriously and think they're worth it 
they also think thinking is a pain


always write down new ideas
