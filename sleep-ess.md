# Sleep ESS

Schools do irreversible damage to children's brains by disregarding and interupting one of the most important natural processes. 

We send our children to school because we want the best for their futures. 
We send our children to school because we want to prepare them for reality. 
We send our children to school because we believe it will aid their brains to learn what the school says is worth learning. 

Our intentions in sending our children to school are the purest. But unfortunately, in practice, schools do the excact opposite. 

Schools do *active, irreversable* damage to your children's brain. This happens in two ways: 

1. Sleep

When school's came about in the 1800's, science of sleep was sparse. Thus waking kids up early in order to go to school was justified. Interuppting your sleep in order to learn was seen as a mark of self-discipline, and in some places still is. 

In the 200 years since however, scientists have come to incredible unanimous agreement on the unbelievable importance of sleep, how much it contributes to brain development. 


What's so bad about interupting sleep? 



If interupting sleep is so bad, how come I'm fine? 

[what to say here that something is wrong with you]

Unfortunately in states of intense sleep deprivation, the brain is unable to accurately measure just h  ow sleep deprived it is. Thus people who are functionnig far, far below their baseline due to inadequate sleep come to treat it as their new normal.

It is an incredibly common and uplifting story of how people come to prioritise their sleep and find great wells of energy and happiness previously unfamiliar to them. 


2. Sleep is vital to learning.
