# Extroversion

Somewhat the opposite of [[social anxiety]]

Extremely beneficial value that boosts life chances.

### Known holders of this value include:
- [[Woz]]
- [[Daniel]]
- [[Raj]]

### To a lesser degree 
- [[Space]]


If you remove other fake forms of social interaction, your extroversion increases! Youtube and Netflix decrease your desire to speak to real humans, they act as a poor substitute.
