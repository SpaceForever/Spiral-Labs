        - Interupting sleep destroys the brain
            - *All schools require the children to wake up early in the morning, often in what is apparent to be incredibly painful conditions for them. Getting out of bed despite your biology screaming at you to sleep is widely considered to be a sign of strength, however not all acts of self-discpline are good. Jumping of a cliff requires self-discipline, but it does not mean it is good for you. Many teenagers *
        - Fighting one's biology is not a sign of strength
            - Not all acts of courage are good.

         - alienmechanic.com
            - A fifteen year old meticulously tracks variables involved in sleep for over a month in an attempt to feel even slightly alert. Sleeping in earlier is found to be the only solution around day 30, but his school does not take his request to sleep in later seriously.

1. Outside the labratory, eliezer yudkowsky. if you see the value of freedom for you, then it should apply to kids too. If not, it's like washing your hands when you're a chef, but not doing it at home. If you don't follow the rules everywhere, if you don't take your professed values seriously, then you don't really understand why those values are good.
