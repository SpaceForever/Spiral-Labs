[[Humility is the key to freedom]]
- Parents need true humility to be able to be good parents, to trust they don't totally know more than their kids
- to not just [profess their humility]() but to actually mean it

[[Tiling the Universe with Freedom]]

[[Total Takeover]] (takeover of emotions over the entire brain)
- [[Kalkidan]]
- Don't let your emotions take you over
- you are seperate from them, and they will trick you into thinking you *are* them
