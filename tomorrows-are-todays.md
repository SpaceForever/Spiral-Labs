# Tomorrows are just Todays

Your life is never going to change. Don't count on anything ever changing, ever. 

Don't glorify the tomorrow. The tomorrow doesn't exist, remember? Don't remember this in the abstract way that you normally do. When "tomorrow" comes, it will be *today*. It will always be today. The present moment is the only moment that exists.

Keep in mind, to all these todays, the common denominator is you.

If you are the type of person to get overwhelmed by stress without any time for yourself, you are the one causing this, and this will stay throughout all your todays. Tomorrows are just todays, tomorrow-yous are just today-yous. 

I can't stress this enough: 

**If you want the tomorrow-you's to be different, change the today-you's!**

I'm not trying to be abstract! If you're the type of person who's sad everyday, don't count on the tomorrow-you's being any different! **Tomorrows are just todays!** If you want tomorrow-yous to be grateful for tomorrows, CHANGE TODAY-YOU.

Don't count at all that all the stress you undergo now will be over soon, once it clears up tomorrow. Tomorrows are just todays, and into every today, you bring with you today-you. If today you is terrible at managing stress, don't you *dare* assume tomorrow-you will swoop in and manage it. 

And my god don't commit the mistake of assuming your problems will ever finish, that they'll ever be a point in which the stream of troubles wade. 

**Life *is* problems.**

Life is just a series of problems. Don't believe me? Look back apon your day so far, your week, your month, your year, the last decade. Life is problem after problem, most of them unexpected.You succeed by adopting this fact as *quickly as possible* and pooling the majority of your recourses into boosting your ability to cope with these problems, either by eliminating them as problems, or by coping with the ones you're not strong enough to eliminate yet, all the while becoming stronger.




A lot of us put a lot of stock into tomorrow. But the future exists only in our collective imaginations. There is no such "thing" as the future, in the same way there is such a "thing" as the screen you're reading this on. Because when the "future" comes, it's the present. It's today. And the only person ever dealing with today's problems is today-you.

It's like you're setting sail on an incredibly important project, where every success matters greatly. And instead of doing the work yourself, you're delegating about 90% of the work to your 90 year old neighbour, Jerry. Strangely you keep finding you end up doing a lot of the work you supposedly delegated, but you don't *really* notice it. 

One day an employee walk up to you, mildly apprenhensive. He asks you to sit down and tells you that they're worried about you, and how much work you're getting done. You tell him you're delegating most of it to Jerry. He tells you Jerry doesn't exist, that he's just a figment of your imagination. That all the work you've been "supposedly giving to Jerry", you're just doing yourself.

You're startled for a second or two, and then say:

"My god! I'm sorry! That must have been quite confusing for you! I know I can't afford to be delegating such important pieces of work to someone that doesn't exist. I'll fix up."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tomorrow-you is *literally* a figment of your imagination. They've never existed and they never will. You are you. The world is as your mind makes it and you have control over your mind. If you expect your mind to feel different because the world changes you are wrong, and it will hurt you if you stick with that belief. That's putting stock in future you to do something you've never been able to do â€” be content. And that's grossly wishful thinking.

You are a human being. You're not programmed by default to be content. Your genes care not for your happiness. Benevolent aliens could dawn the planet in an hour and spread unlimited recourses, eliminating stress, freeing you from the rat-race and opening you to a world of experiences.

But let me make it exceptionally clear: *tomorrow-you is today-you. Tomorrow-you is able to sustain just as much wonder for a utopian environment as today-you is for *your* environment now*.

If today you doesn't see every opportunity to peak at a tree or the glorious sky or a scuttling squirrel as a suprememe gift, what makes you think anything different would be if you were placed in a utopian society? 

**Tomorrows are just todays**. If you want tomorrow-you's to be even *slightly* different, more powerful, less worried about what other people think, whatever it is, ***FIX today-you.***.
