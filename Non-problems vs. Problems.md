basically what in your life is effortless and what isn't
e.g. drinking water is effortleess
teaching sm is effortless for Raj.
convincing someone to use it is a bit effortful

> If someone told you to spell out your name, would you grown and spit out each letter spitefully? No? Then do the same in your daily life. ~ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
