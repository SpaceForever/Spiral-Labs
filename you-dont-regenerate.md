# You Don't Regenerate — Ever

*And stay safe. Becuase outside your own game if you die you don't regenerate — EVER*. 

## Inevitable Conciousness Fallacy

I used to follow a flawed pattern of reasoning. 

    I am concious and aware
    If I was not concious and aware I would not be concious of that fact
    Thus the default state of the universe is me being aware of my existence

And this lead me to not take death very seriously. After all, if I died, it's inevitable *I'd* be back. I kind of assumed I'd manafiest in something else. A week form of buddhist reincarnation, I guess. 

I've implicitly held this belief for foreover. 

But then I saw a video of a brain.


## Mushy Brain

[Attatch video of brain] 

This is a video of a person holding a brain. A human brain.

See that mushy lump of meat we don't have much emotional attatchment towards?

*That's* a *person*. 

That was a *thing like you* that was concious and had hopes and dreams and wants and regrets and so many experiences and SO MANY THOUGHTS for time it was alive. 

And then, something went wrong, and something bad happened to the part of it that made it aware of itself. 

So it's there, indisinguishabele from a slab of meat or a rock. Just another piece of matter in the universe. 

— 

In your skull, there's a chucnk of meat, and that meat is you. 

We call them 'our' brains, almost as if we see our identities as little homoncoli. 

But nope. Our brains *are* us. 

Stand very still. Try not to feel anything. I want you to close your eyes for 10 seconds. 

Back?

So you didn't see, right? You had no visual information coming in. You were still there. 

You didn't move too much. You had very little sensory information coming in from the touch-sensors all over your body. You were still there.

I can extract your eyes and you will still be there. I can snatch your body and you will still be there. 

But the *second* I do something to your brain.. maybe carve out a chunk, or make a little dent... 

Can you even *imagine* what that'd feel like? What something like that would do to your sense of identity?

We *know* from the phenomenon of dreaming that our brains can manifest reality to be whatever it wants, and we will believe it. 

The point is: our brains **are** us. We're not sepaarate from them, we're not little homonculi. Fuck up your brain and you're gone — and you don't regenerate. Your a rock who's configuration was so complex it became aware it was a rock.

## Tragedy of Lives Lost

Now that I see human beings as extremely meaty brain configuations, I understand how much of a tragedy death is. Because once you die — once something happens to your brain — you're gone, and you don't regenerate — *ever*. 

Each human being is just a special combination of neurons, which have a whole bunch of sensory experiences, and then rot, and they don't regenerate. 

Imagine all the millions of soldiers who lost their entire selves during all the wars? All the oppressed who had their one shot of existance snatched! 

Their brain configurations aren't coming back!!! 

I'm really not sure how much of this is just me. I feel like i've just understood, properly and finally, that death is permenant. Does this resonate with you? If your heart didn't already grasp this, does it now? Is it dropping like a stone at the realisation of the finality of it all? 


## Suicide

And with this I also finally understand why suicide is like actually properly bad and people don't want you to do it. If you screw over your brain by murdering it, it doesn't regenrate in another time, or another person, or universe, or realm. 

You screw over a highly specific configeration of muscle tissue that was so perfectly, specifically configurated as to make you aware of your existence...

... and it doesn't regenerate. 

You don't come back in five years, or ten, or twenty. This isn't pressing a fast-forward button on life. 

You don't get the satisfaction of haunting over those who screwed you in voice recordings or as a phantom. 

You're GONE. 

GONE. 

AND NEVER FUCKING COMING BACK FOR ALL OF THE REST OF TIME. 

Your unvierse is fucking deleted! Erased! Not moved into the recycling bin, but straight up eradicated! 

Utterly tracelss. 

I'm sure you've heard that 'sleep is just death being shy'. They're both a form of unconcious. You are your brain, and your brain is thoughts. Do *anything* to those thoughts and it's a different person, turn them off and you're unconciousness. Thus time passes infinitely quickly. 

When you wake up in the morning, you've just travelled through time. (This sensation of time-hopping is particularly poignant when you have friends in other timezones. At 22:00 I go to sleep and my friend in japan wakes up at his 07:00, I blink and it's 09:00 for me and 18:00 for him. Time travel.)

Thoughts give us a measure of time. Without them, time passes in an instant. 

> Enlightenment is the space between thoughts

Perhaps that's why enlightenment is so had to reach. Because by the time we get there, no matter how long we spend in it, time instantaneously passess. 

There is no subjective difference between a minute and a hundred billion trillion years when you are unconcious. 


So when you eradicate your brain, be prepared for your subjective experience to skip through millenia, eons, trillions and trillions of years of nothingness, nowhere and with nothing. An instant after you are gone the earth will crumble, humanity will crumble, a billion stars will explode and the universe will collapse, and through this unconciousness you will keep skipping through eons in microinstants.

But this doesn't matter, becuase you're not fast-forwarding a movie. 

You're not *going* somwhere. 

You're not actually travelling through time. 

There's no destination. 

There's no "other side" that you'll come out on. 

There's no more experience. No more wants. No more knowing. No more relief. No more sight, no more touch. 

NOTHING. 

You deleted yourself, remmeber?

Be terrified of death. 





## Body swap homonculous




One day people will look at your body and something wrong will've happened in your brain and there will be no you left. 

Truly scary the ease at which we control our muscles. Try focus super, super hard on how it feels like to will your arm even slightly raised. Do you feel *anything*, or is it just a part of you? It just feels like the parts you can control this effortlessly *are* you!


"*This world is not real*" - inception



 are **deeply** tethered
