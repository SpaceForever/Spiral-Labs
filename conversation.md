Raj expand wishes for [[thread-rambler]]

#Space what wishes do you want expanded?

ok for now i'll just work on it then show u and u incrementally push me to the Way

#Space it should fix these use cases:
-have threads I want to send out to people. should be able to quickly write line about it, mark it for email and recipients
-when in email slot, should be able to see all threads marked for email. should then be able to go thread by thread to resolve them (generally send out email)

(others tbd)
