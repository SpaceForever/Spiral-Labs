Is Space clone of Raj and Woz? Where is Space?

Imagine 60 years from now talking to people who aren't woz and raj. What would you regret?


Raj - how to make the world better. have i created people that save the world from suffering?

space worried he's losing past selves

dont necessarily assume things (eg. feelings) are immutable

@sock#9105 I think raj mentioned to you my mum's openness to me skipping college on the basis of me getting some amount of money to prove I'm competent —  and I'd really like to not go to college for the freedom and how all my other goals hinge apon that. As you know I'm utilitarian too and I think I could become a great deal more competent and effective if I could spend the two years in resource mode as opposed to wasting futile effort in school. Can definately be more useful in spiral-labs endevours with raj. (As well as be better physiologically as I can sleep). does this seem like something you'd be interested in helping in through funding? I could also be apprentice / VA to you. 


> Resource Mode
The idea is this — there are a set of behaviors that almost always make sense to do. 

We could call this “Serving Future You” — but when someone else asks, “What are you doing with your life?” — that’s a hard question to answer. That question is a very unpleasant one for people who don’t know what they’re doing.

Try this answer on for size — “I’m in Resource Mode.”

The authors both strongly believe that “I’m in Resource Mode” is going to become a far more common answer to the question of what you’re doing with your life. The 1900’s benefited from people specializing heavily and early, committing when a junior or senior in high school to a basic university path, and getting into a career chosen by their teenage-selves.

There is so much more malleability and opportunity today, a huge demand for generalized effectiveness and ability, and far lower requirements of being within mainstream institutions to be effective.

 

Hence, Resource Mode. You can set campaigns to train more effectiveness and skills into yourself, meet great people and form good bonds, tangibly prove that you’re trustworthy and effective, and get assets going that will serve you.

All of these things are very smart things to do with a cheerful smile on your face, even if you’re not sure what these various resources will eventually translate into. Here’s the thing — they’ll translate into something.

In two years, you’ll be two years older regardless. You could sit around in a depressed ennui because you’re not animated with a clear sense of meaning, or you could learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people, improve, prove your improvements through tangible projects, and have a fuller bank account and better tools at the end of this.

 

A strange sight to see is when someone who is young and confused about their path is accomplishing lots of things, but feeling generally miserable because they “don’t know what they’re doing” — and we live in a world where the question of “What are you doing with your life?” is given such undue force and weight. Parents, relatives, acquaintances — heck, people you just met at a party — they get concerned or sympathetic if you don’t have a good answer to the question.

But when an entrepreneur or other figure living an obviously cool life points out that the young person is well-suited to keep doing what they’re doing and stacking up those resources, everything shifts.

You don’t need to know what you’re doing early. Many people don’t. Even worse, many people who don’t know arbitrarily make bad decisions and commit hard to do them just so they can answer the question.

A great alternative — Resource Mode. Stack up useful resources. They will aid you greatly when you inevitably discover a great sense of precise meaning, which you don’t have to be in any hurry to do.
