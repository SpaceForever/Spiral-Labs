# Meeting 4

Is Space clone of Raj and Woz? Where is Space?

Imagine 60 years from now talking to people who aren't woz and raj. What would you regret?


Raj - how to make the world better. have i created people that save the world from suffering?

space worried he's losing past selves

dont necessarily assume things (eg. feelings) are immutable

@sock#9105 I think raj mentioned to you my mum's openness to me skipping college on the basis of me getting some amount of money to prove I'm competent â€”  and I'd really like to not go to college for the freedom and how all my other goals hinge apon that. As you know I'm utilitarian too and I think I could become a great deal more competent and effective if I could spend the two years in resource mode as opposed to wasting futile effort in school. Can definately be more useful in spiral-labs endevours with raj. (As well as be better physiologically as I can sleep). does this seem like something you'd be interested in helping in through funding? I could also be apprentice / VA to you.
