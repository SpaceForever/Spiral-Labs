# What Prevents Acquisition of All Knowledge

what's the missing thing around knowledge that mkaes it imperfect? likely difficulty of applying

from SM IW:
Title: What prevents immediate acquisition of perfect wisdom? (open question) 

The majority of all important knowledge is already out there on the internet, accessible to a significant portion of humanity. Vast writings on wisdom are accessible to us but most of us are still foolish. This isn't a game where you have to level up till you can use the level 100 spellbooks. They're as accesible now as they will be 20 years from now. 


The level 100 spellbooks are out there. What prevents instant perfection?

Why can't you become a productivity god over night?

I think there are a few answers:

-earning generalizationsro

-tacit knowledge/procedural adaption to circumstances

The earning generalizations part is important; what that means is that even if the knowledge is there, you hvae to internalize it. Is too hard to do that and most people have no mechanism for it.

Other issue might be volume. Is plenty of crazy good stuff out htere. But is too much crazy good. hard to sort through. What makes something memetic is not always what makes something useful
