# Law of Infinite Knowledge

(working title, please suggest alternatives)

What separates being able to look at 100 articles vs. a thousand?
How much better is access to 100 vs 1000 assuming you have only enough time to read say 100 pages worth?

Incrementally you should be able to sift out the golden nuggets and get rid of the poorer ones; this means that over time the average quality of your pot will increase
think of it like gold panning 
(need image)
IR is your filter

the more rocks you have to filter through more gold?
doesn't work exactly think more 

30%

You have to get pickier at what you do the more high priority thing you're exposed to.

5 articles has 100% priority protection over a year at 30m a day;
10,000 has say 50%
100,000 has maybe 5%
as priority protection decrease quality of each is higher and higher isn't  it

same for tasks too as you get more skilled you msut choose more carefulyl higeher value tasks over and over
