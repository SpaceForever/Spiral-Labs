# The Demon On My Shoulder

The demon first arrived when I was twelve. Until then school had been quite fun really. Tests were of low priority and no one really stressed you out about them too much. Until year 8, when new management came under my school. They began to create stakes to the exams.

 I remember the first big maths exam they had us worry about. It'd determine which maths class you'd be in, they said. It was of upmost importance you do well for it, they said. 

 Around the same time, a demon appeared on my shoulder.

 I went to my teacher and asked what the demon was doing there, showing it to him. He said: "It's supposed to be there. You're fine."

 "Why is it here?" I asked. 

 "It reminds you to study," the teacher said with a smile. "Don't forget, you have an exam next week."

 I felt a sharp pain - the demon had dug its claws into my shoulder. 

 "Ow! What was that for?"

 "Have you studied yet?" my teacher said in response, as if the pain was normal. 

And so I woke up each morning, and I studied. I noticed whenever I studied the demon's latch onto my arm was lighter. The more prepared for the test I was the less it hurt, and when the exam came I aced it, and I noticed the demon was gone. I felt lighter.

Over the next year, I grew accustomed to the demon's presence whenever a test came. The bigger the (teacher's *said*) the stakes were, the worse the demon's claws hurt, but still I reliveshed the feeling of a painless shoulder at the end of every exam, when the demon let me go. 

Until one time, at the end of the summer exams, it didn't.

I went to my teacher and asked what the demon was still doing there. She said: "It's there to remind you to study over the summer of course! You have your Big Exams coming up in 2 years, remember? Time flies, you'll want to start studying now. Have a nice summer!"

My teacher walked out of the room, and the demon sunk it's nails deeper, piercing my uniform and tapping its claws against my skin. 

I was terrified. I'd adjusted to the demon's presence, knowing it left whenever I completed an exam. But the exam was two years away! 

I began to shake ferociously to try and get the demon off, a foolish, foolish move. I knew any attempts to reliquinquish myself from the demon's grasp would only lead to more pain, and this time wasn't an exepction. It pierced it's claws into my skin. I cried out in the classroom. 

After a while, I apologised to the demon.

After the summer, my sleep deteriorated. Some research showed me I was reaching the age where teenagers sleep cycle naturally drifted later into the morning, where simply tryiing to sleep earlier would have little effect. So I asked if I could go to school later in the morning. They laughed. They reminded me I couldn't miss lessons because of the Big Exams on the horizon. Still I tried, for months and months. But the daily energy I had been used to didn't return.

The demon didn't help. 

It didn't leave my shoulder during slumber. It didn't mellow during the night. It invaded my dreams, it poked and prodded me with it's needly razor sharp talons. 

And when it finally mellowed in the early hours of the morning, when my sleep would finally matter, the alarm rung. For a couple, blissful, amnesiatic seconds the Demon's presence was forgotten. 

Then the cycle spun back up.

These days I couldn't study. I couldn't focus, I had no energy. So I had no relief from the demon's pain. The less I studied the worse I did on tests, the worse I did on tests the bigger and stronger the demon grew. The bigger the demon was the more it weighed on me with every step I took, and the stronger the demon was, the more it invaded my sleep, yet worsening my energy, making the cycle only worse.

I went to my teacher and asked how to get rid of the demon.

"You don't *get rid of the demon*. Why do you think you can do that? I had to go through it, we all had to! The demon is good! It's presence builds character! These Big Exams are *very important* to your *entire future*, remember?"

I went to my mum and begged her to get the demon off me. She appeared to listen lovingly. I was hopeful, for a moment. She said:

"What did the teachers say?"

"That everyone goes through it.. and that it's good..."

She thought for a moment. "Ok, then what's the problem?"

"It *hurts* mum! I don't like it! It won't let me sleep! I didn't even ever ask for it to be here! I didn't want to do these tests! Please mum!"

"*Everyone*
