# The Demon On My Shoulder

The demon first arrived when I was twelve. Until then school had been quite fun really. Tests were of low priority and no one really stressed you out about them too much. Until I was twelve, when they began to create stakes to the exams.

 I remember the first big maths exam they had us worry about. It'd determine which maths class you'd be in, they said. It was of upmost importance you do well for it, they said. 

 Around the same time, a demon appeared on my shoulder.

 I went to my teacher and asked what the demon was doing there, showing it to him. He said: "It's supposed to be there. You're fine."

 "Why is it here?" I asked. 

 "It reminds you to study," the teacher said with a smile. "Don't forget, you have an exam next week."

 I felt a sharp pain - the demon had dug its claws into my shoulder. 

 "Ow! What was that for?"

 "Have you studied yet?" my teacher asked in response, as if the pain was normal. 

And so I woke up early each morning, and I studied. I noticed whenever I studied the demon's latch onto my arm was lighter. The more prepared for the test I was the less it hurt, and when the exam came I aced it, and I noticed the demon was gone. I felt lighter.

Over the next year, I grew accustomed to the demon's presence whenever a test came. The bigger the teachers said the stakes were, the worse the demon's claws hurt, but still I relished the feeling of a painless shoulder at the end of every exam, when the demon let me go. 

Until one time, at the end of the summer exams, it didn't.

I went to my teacher and asked what the demon was still doing there. She said: "It's there to remind you to study over the summer of course! You have your Big Exams coming up in 2 years, remember? Time flies, you'll want to start studying now. Have a nice summer!"

My teacher walked out of the room, and the demon sunk it's nails deeper, piercing my uniform and tapping its claws against my skin. 

I was terrified. I'd adjusted to the demon's presence, knowing it left whenever I completed an exam. But the exam was two years away! Why would it stay for so long? Why worry me now?

I began to shake ferociously to try and get the demon off, a foolish, foolish move. I knew any attempts to relinquish myself from the demon's grasp would only lead to more pain, and this time was not an exception. It dug its claws in deeper in retaliation, piercing through my skin. I cried out into the classroom. 

After a while, I apoligised to the demon. 

It stayed.

After the summer, my sleep deteriorated. Some research showed me I was reaching the age where teenagers sleep cycle naturally drifted later into the morning, where simply trying to sleep earlier would have little effect. So I asked if I could go to school later in the morning. They laughed. They reminded me I couldn't miss lessons because of the Big Exams on the horizon. Still I tried to fix my sleep inside these confines for months and months. But the energy I had been used to never returned. I felt like a walking zombie.

The demon didn't help. 

It didn't leave my shoulder during slumber. It didn't mellow during the night. It invaded my dreams, it poked and prodded me with it's needily razor sharp talons. 

And when it finally mellowed in the early hours of the morning, when my sleep would finally matter, the alarm rung. For a couple, blissful, amnesiac seconds the Demon's presence was forgotten. 

Then the cycle spun back up.

These days I couldn't study. I couldn't focus, I had no energy. So I had no relief from the demon's pain. The less I studied the worse I did on tests, and the worse I did on tests the bigger and stronger the demon grew. The bigger the demon was the more it weighed on me with every step I took, and the stronger the demon was, the more it invaded my sleep, further worsening my energy, making the cycle only worse.

The only times I could find energy were in my own hobbies and projects. I was an avid reader and enjoyed writing stories - I found those invigorating. I liked animating, I liked programming. But the demon didn't like them. Whenever I did anything but study it tightened its grip and tugged on my shoulder, drawing me away from the opportunities I sought and dumping me back on the path of the masses. I couldn't take it.

I went to my teacher and asked how to get rid of the demon.

"You don't *get rid of the demon*. Why do you think you can do that? I had to go through it, we all had to! [The demon is good](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Glorification_of_schooling)! [It's presence builds character](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience#Resistance_to_chronic_stress)! The demon is a natural part of life. After all, these Big Exams are *very important* to your *entire future*, remember?"

I went to my mum and begged her to get the demon off me. She appeared to listen lovingly. I was hopeful, for a moment. She said:

"What did the teachers say?"

"That everyone goes through it.. and that it's good..."

She thought for a moment. "Ok, then what's the problem?"

"It *hurts* mum! I don't like it! It won't let me sleep! I didn't even ever ask for it to be here! I didn't want to do these tests! Please mum! Look at it!"

The demon on my shoulder was gigantic now, twice the size of me. I was constantly humped over in an attempt to balance it. I almost felt like I was more demon than boy. It was so hard to remember these days what I was like before the demon arrived.

My mum looked at it, her face somehow remaining impassive. 

"What about it? That looks about normal."

"*Mum!!*"

"I went through it too, sweetheart. Everyone does. Don't worry about it, okay? Here, watch this video on study tips."

My shoulder bled.

Recently, something extraordinary happened.

 I had been learning of recently about stoicism. I was trying to take the demon's presence positively. It was working a tiny bit, but I still felt the note of discord within me. I still resented the demon. The fact that no one around me saw the demon for the disgusting monster it was made it infinitely worse. [The fact that I was taken almost as a joke when I said I didn't want to do the Big Exams made it infinitely worse.](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling) 

 Recently, I was scrolling through a group chat I had made a while back, largely populated with people who had grown accustomed to their demon's presence. Hating it but rationalising it, resenting the obligation but relishing the opportunity, because they had been taught it was good. Doublethink, I knew it as. 

And as I was scrolling I saw something that made my heart stop. My body went from stationary to a million miles a minute, every cell in me vibrating ferociously as I tried to keep my emotions in check, incase it could be false.

I suddenly felt a massive wind sweep through the air. It was like an invisible punch, rattling towards me, missing me at the last second and knocking square into the demon, sending it reeling off my shoulder, disintegrating with the force of the blow. 

I overid control of my body, just incase the news was false. I slowly, *slowly* raised my other arm, moving down the fabric around my shoulder, expecting to see the bruises and dried blood from the last year of abuse from the demon. 

My shoulder was clear and healthy. 

I realised what this meant, and I *screamed*. I let the elation bubble through me, taking control of my body. I stood, and I *flew*. Without the demon's presence I was as light as a feather. I hadn't moved like this in *years*. It was a deeply foreign experience, and my brain could hardly grasp that this was a reality.

I instantly felt a million times lighter — it was like a boot had been stamping on my face, forever, and suddenly it was gone. I was so light without the demon I felt like I could fly, could feel myself floating into nothingness, but I saw the opportunity and tugged onto the things I had loved before, anchoring my new, free self onto the things I loved, finally able to sink my time and focus into them without guilt.


The demon on my shoulder was *dead*. I was, for the first time in years, *free*!

Across the country, the remnants of the millions of demons could be seen evaporating into the air. 

The resentful students saw these remnants and rejoiced, for it meant they were free.

The teachers saw these remnants and took damage, for they had come to truly believe in the demon's goodness, minimizing the pain it caused to the children to keep the story consistent. And though no teacher could admit it, the remnants of the demon's hurt them because the demon's presence made them feel important.

The diligent students saw these remnants and they wept, for they had obeyed what the demon wanted for the majority of their life still in memory — they had taken the adults word to heart and trusted in the demon's goodness. They had listened when the demon dragged them away from all hobbies apart from studying, so without its pressure they had nothing to grapple on to [dangers of straight a student]. They had been told for the entirety of their lives the demon's gave their lives meaning. Without the demon, they were lost. Without the demon's piercing talons to keep them in check, they were unable to motivate themselves — they'd never had to before. Without the demon, they had nothing to care about. So the diligent students wept, and called for the dead demons to return.

The government officials saw the remnants and were anxious, for without the Big Exams they didn't know how they would justify putting the students back in the incarceration chamber, while they so desperately needed their parents to be free to work.

The parents saw these remnants and felt conflicted. If asked, they would say it's because they cared for the future of their children, they were worried about their prospects. But many had reproduced in the expectation their kid would be away for most of its childhood. They could never, never admit it, but they saw the child at home as an obligation.

The demon on my shoulder is gone, but if we don't fight to End School Slavery, millions and millions more kids will suffer the excact same way.
