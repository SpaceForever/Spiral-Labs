# Schools Cripple Change

[[Space]]

Schooling does incredible, monumental damage for humanitie's progress by stripping new humans of their fundamental right â€” their right to believe they can change the world.

Nowadays believing you can change the world is a rare thing, and this is because of schooling. What else would you expect from being plumped into a system that tells you excactly what to do every second of your life for 16 years, punishing you when you try to go against the status quo? 

Schools drill into young minds nothing better than "*the world is the way it is. Trying to change it is futile*". As such a child who believes she can actually change the world is looked at with pleasant condicendance, an image of naievity. 

But the child is not naive. THE WORLD IS MUTABLE. We MUST believe this is we want to get anything done. 

I'm sure you have YOUr special fight. the cause that lights your soul on fire. it's being stopped by schooling.
