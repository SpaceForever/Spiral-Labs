How to do schooling.

Work can always be in the same book. 

In what format do i have to write the least?
- voice is quickest



Paying Kids to do my schoolwork: 

At minimum i'd get immense gains if it was just for maths, since that takes up a massive chunk of my time and the questions are online so don't have to worry about handwriting risks.

potential risks: 

- school sees IP adress
  - unlikely. Why would they? 
- kid writes in a style that's foreign to me and i get caught
- they could snitch and get me in trouble
  - pick someone trustworthy. Most kids like me anyway

People:

- Salima
  - reliable
  - wants money probably

Plan:
At the very minimum they do hegarty for me since that's super easy. 
That'll free up some 5~ hours per week.

How much would that be, like 20£ a week for all hegarty for 5 hours of work? that's 80£ a a month, a fair bit. 
FUCK me
I just want a break. 
I don't have to not have a break...
