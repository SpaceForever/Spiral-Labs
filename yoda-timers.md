# Yoda Timers

[[Intrumental Rationality]] technique from [[Hammertime]].

The art of using five minute timers in which you must get something done, to channel the power of deadlines.

An [[Autohotkey]] script for quick yoda timers by [[Space]]: https://github.com/SpaceForever/fancy-autohotkeys/blob/main/General%20Scripts/yodaTimer.ahk

## How to maintain their power
There is a risk over time that you will take the timers less seriously. This can theoretically be remedied by:
- Limiting the amount you set each day (eg. 1-3)
- Taking them seriously in that limit
