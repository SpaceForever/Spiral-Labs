# Increasing the Funnel

This is a [[Metaphor]] about the purpose of helping other people.

The further along the funnel you go, the more compentent and skilled you are, so you can start working on more important problems. At the very end of the funnel are people like [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and [[Nate Soares]], who are directly working on AI alignment.



I want to make as many other people as good as possible
