# Africa



Am doing project where I incidentally am looking at some African countries which are major outliers in bad ways for lots of data.

I have vague thought in my head of: it seems like deltas between Africa and world are high so any attempted improvements there would have highest returns

Am vaguely curious about: how could you get people to do good learning there (maybe through [[SuperMemo]]) and ideally through that improve status quo?
