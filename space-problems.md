# Space Problems

Mortality -> just brain

reality

**Identity**
    - if i've rejected the one i had pushed onto me, i need to choose a new one
    - there's nothing that i will say 'ah yes this is it' becuase they're just stories

**Five chimps**
    - friends making me too pessimistic?


## Anger
    - how can you be disconnected from reality and still be angry?
    - why not be like [[Daniel]] and only be connected to reality where there is love?



## Interpreting Reality?
    

### Manipulating reality?
    1. really easy + stoicism
    2. can't consistently interpret narrative, life would be terrible, if you choose a narrative

### Interacting with people
    - value that could make me not miserable when talking to people?
        Raj: *If I was born as them i would do the same thing*
        We are all going to die?
        using spaced repetition to make cards about interacting with people. wait till the idea is embedded in your mind.
            - 



## Just Wants to Meditate

*I don't need to be helpful to others if I don't want to.*

Raj wants to go to America and be like Alex Gierov?




## What do I want?
    - have a close group of friends
    - explore the world


## Where to go from here?
    - triple investments with friends?
