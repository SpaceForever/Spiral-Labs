## Foam Proposal

In SuperMemo, incremental writing is based on two facets: priorities and intervals. Imagine that I have this mindmap which I wish to convert into a wiki:
I can construct a simple queue:
and finish writing each post before moving on. This *functions* but has the downside of being highly arbitrary. Writing in order of last added or in random order is not efficient. SuperMemo handles this with priorities:
[image of queue]
(0 is highest and 100 is lowest priority)
SM priorities are assigned by me and are at my discretion. SM then uses its sort algorithm which doesn't sort by pure priority (to prevent [prioritiy bias]()). 
Using priorities, we can then go through list in less arbitrary order and get some added efficiency:

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Priorities]: priorities "Priorities"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
