Working title

Thread rambler is meant to allow for writing down all threads you want and using microtags in each line for TR  to put them in the right place
e.g.:

should I buy speakers /alan /message
thread rambler should sink lists with other people that are cool /space /write /email

try remnote /task


rat maze: app idea /space  /email /write

game strategies idea /space /email
live long enough to get equivalent life extension /me /idea


yerba mate is really freaking good /SM friends /discord

learn design, find devs /me


these should then be sorted to respective lists. if I have my email list it would be:
/email: 
thread rambler should sink lists with other people that are cool /space /write /email
rat maze: app idea /space  /email /write
game strategies idea /space /email

which I can then deal with when email slot

otherwise I could group them by person
thread rambler should sink lists with other people that are cool /space /write /email
rat maze: app idea /space  /email /write
game strategies idea /space /email

so that when I talk to space next I resolve all threads I want to open.

To push thread rambling to higher efficiency, ideally common threads between me and space would be synced. He would see all my /space tags and I would see all his /raj. It would be faster communication than email.

This introduces problem of having too many threads: an element of prioritization is required. 
This requires value/time tasklist functionality. 
Value could be measured as a number between 1-9, time could be measured by minutes and urgency could also be captured on a log scale: a for days, be for week, c for month, d for year. Or something
