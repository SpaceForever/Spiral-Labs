I recently came across this isolated extract  during my [[Incremental Reading]] session in [[SuperMemo]]:

> _“But we know exactly how and where we can be hurt, and why. That is as good a definition as any of self-consciousness._"

And I thought "Oh, okay, yeah. I guess knowing where you can be hurt is pretty wise."

I didn't actually stop to think about the meaning of the word 'self-conciousness'.

Self conciousness is steryotipcally thought of in a high school situation, where insecure teens are telling lies or covering up zits to avoid being made fun of, because they know that they take damage, that they're hurt, whenever anyone makes fun of them. 
 
This is obviously weakness.

So then I thought with blazingly bright realisation: self-conciousness is weakness! Knowing where you can be hurt is weakness! 

Becuase if you *know* where you can be hurt, it means you're not doing anything about it. If you know that whenever someone makes a crack at your height it'll hurt you, that's not strength — that's looking at an insecurity in your operating system and **letting it live there**.

Bugs are supposed to be fixed. We aren't like moths, who are built in with the bug of being attracted to bright lights all the time even when it kills them — we're human beings. We can, expect for in extreme biological wirings (like food and sex) analyse our drives and our bugs and the weakness we were born with and ask ourselves if we want to keep them in here, or if we want to realign what we're being told by our body to meet the needs we want met painlessly.

And you can change these things, remember, [[Your Emotions Aren't You]]
