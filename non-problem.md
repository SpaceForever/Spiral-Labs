# Non Problem

Things that are no longer a problem. [[Woz]] is an example of someone who has acquired so much knowledge, wisdom and [[experience-points]] that many problems that rack the brains of [[Raj]] and [[Space]] are trivially easy for him to solve.

As you solve more problems manually, the steps requried to solve them become instinct.

> The difference between any problem and its solution is knowledge

[[Stoicism]], followed to its logical conclusion, should convert all problems into non-problems.
