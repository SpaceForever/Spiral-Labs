# Formula for Persuasion

Appeal to common values, and spam? (What [[Woz]] did. )

1. Clear yourself of [[negative emotions]] using empathy.
   -  If person is angry: Remember they don't understand that [[anger]] is not very useful, and they're probably not a very happy person in general. Thus: pity.

agressive person is making arguments and you have to respond. You can't just leave. How to disarm?

2. Think win-win
   - Understand their concerns (don't overwrite them with yours)
    - Locate common values. Appeal to common values.
