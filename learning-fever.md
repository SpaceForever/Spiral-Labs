# Learning Fever

(Why called 'Learning Fever'? Doesn't seem like very descriptive name)

[[Woz]] says to cover up negative emotions hindering big picture and other stuff with more learning

this might seem strange but for users of [[SuperMemo]] when you get far enough into queue and are just In It you'll feel it
outer world fades to black and it's only you and the learning
fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
