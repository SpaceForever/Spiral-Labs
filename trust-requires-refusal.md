# Trust Requires Refusal

I am able to talk and come to many cool ideas with [[Space]] and suggest things because I know he will refuse
if he's not willing then i can't suggest things as far out as I want to! Thus refusing ideas is an antidote for the highly dangerous [[Groupthink]]

(or as [[Phoenix]] put it while doing [[Hammertime]], Boundaries are fuckin g important!)

[Space]: Space "Space"
[Hammertime]: hammertime "Hammertime"
