# Writing

Writing is vital in changing people's minds, thinking clearly and creatively, contributing value to the world and in [[memetics]] and [[persuasion]].

> If you care about changing the world, you should write for other people as much as is useful. And as much as is useful you write for yourself. ~Raj

If we wanna make posts that help people we should write about what people need.
