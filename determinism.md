# Determinism

Determinism is a philosophy that people's actions are inevitable given their brain / background and other factors. Thus they cannot be held morally accountable for their actions. Realising and accepting  determinism is an inevitable cornerstone one reaches in the path to maturity, resulting in the only acceptable emotion towards other human beings being love, not [[anger]].

[[Desire Causes Suffering]]
[[Stoicism]]?
only focus on physiological needs and desiring things for those
don't desire other stuff?


remember big picture suffering to limit current desires
is that vlid or no â€” I think pretty valid


## Physical Determism
This states that due to whatever physical laws started the universe, it has been a constant cause and effect since the beginning of time, so in some sense everything is "bound" to happen. We still have choices though.
