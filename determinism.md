# Determinism

Determinism is a philosphy that people's actions are inevitable given their brain / background and other factors. Thus they cannot be held morally accountable for their actions. Realising and accepting  determism is an inevitable cornerstone one reaches in the path to maturity, resulting in the only acceptable emotion towards other human beings being love.
