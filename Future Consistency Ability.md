# Future Consistency Ability

Future Consistency Ability (FCA) is the ability reliably predict your future behaviour. 

FCA is the most important habit of all. 

People with FCA essentially have their shit together. 

[Raemon from Sunet at Noon ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2x7fwbwb35sG8QmEt/sunset-at-noon) is a stellar example of what it feels like to have FCA. 


### How to Attain It

- you can try enviornmental changes
- or try [[microrules]]


### Some things that can be done once you have FCA: 

 - Start tracking things consisently
 - Create TAPs confidently and consistently
 - Having systems to ensure the most important things get done, and a collection of habits that makes sure that important things end up in those systems.
