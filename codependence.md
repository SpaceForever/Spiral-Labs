# Codependence

One needs to put their eggs in multiple baskets. As [[Leaf]] sometimes mentions, having a single person be the only exciting thing in your life puts a lot of pressure of them and leads into misery for when they're not around.

One must tune their own problem solving ability so that they don't need the other around to solve problems.

How else to solve this? Ideas?

Problem [[Space]] is almost a little bit facing with [[Raj]] as he talks to him the most often thus he is almost the only person who is totally up to date on what's going on in Space's life.
