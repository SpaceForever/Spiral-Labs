# The Box

The box is a short story by [[Naval Ravikant]]. If you haven't read it, read it now. Spoiilers ahead. It's very short and very good, read it. You only get one chance to make your own interpretation of it.

The box outlines the nature of conciousness. How, since our brains manifest reality inside them, life could very well be an extremely vivid dream. Reality could be whatever it wants, and you can't know if that's not the case. 

You could be in *very* many places. You are on earth, in the milky way. 

What do you do if you can't trust reality?

[[Stoicism]] tells us we have freedom of interpretation.

## Conerns
Raj: I just realized that you ([[Space]]) have basically done the box and are at the point where you can choose what to see except you don’t have attachment that makes that scary. What do you think Naval’s answer to it is? I have a conception of it but I think thinking about it yourself would help you a lot
