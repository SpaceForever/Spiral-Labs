# Humanistic Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a philosophy of maximizing overall happiness and minimizing overall suffering

For humans, practically, this is quite hard to do efficiently. Optimizing per moment actions is very hard; constantly engaging [[System 2]] is a big pain

based on [[supermemo.guru]] and [[Woz]]'s writings, I've realized that if you want to actually be utilitarian you have to have good [[internal alignment]] with both your [[physiological needs]] as well as your [[psychological needs]]

I've been roughly utilitarian since when was kid
I was terrible utilitarian though and screwed aronud lots and felt terrible about it

I think for anyone that wants to do [[effective altruism]]/[[saving the world]] it's important to understand [[ergodocity]]
