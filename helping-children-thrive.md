    - depression
    > Studies of adolescents have identified a link between sleep disruption and suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and, tragically, suicide completion in the days after
    > After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours.
    > Specifically, it is estimated that up to 90% of people with depressive disorders experience sleep problems.

    - sleep science is new
    - society is only recently learning to appreciate sleep, just like it only recently learned to appreciate mental health
