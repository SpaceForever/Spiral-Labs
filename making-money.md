# Making Money


[[Naval Ravikant]]

The first half of [[The navalmanack]] is excactly about this. 


## Principles
- Instead of asking someone if they would pay for something, asking them to pay for it.

## Concerns
- Money-oriented optimization in the modern world will lead to losing a clear creative focus ~ Woz


## Discussion from [[Sock]] and [[Lunis]]
- Does someone's willingness to pay reflect their commitment? Is their feedback more valuable?
